# About Stupid Genius Software

I make interesting things; that's pretty much the sole criterion for how I decide what projects to work on.  I never worry about not having an answer when people ask me "what's the point of that?"â€”I work on things that I find interesting and that strategy has served me well over the years.

This is a collection of small to medium sized projects and demonstrations that I've worked on.  The front page itself is a demonstration of CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts.  I hope you enjoy exploring my projects as much as I enjoyed working on them.
